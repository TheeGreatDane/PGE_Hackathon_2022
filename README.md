# PGE_Hackathon_2022
UT Energy A.I. Hackathon 2022

Goal: Develop a data analytics and machine learning workflow in Python to:

- Select the best 3 infill well locations and associated completion intervals (upper or lower) that maximize the cumulative oil production over the next 2 years
- Predict the cumulative oil production over the next 2 years for each of your proposed wells
Background

We challenge the Energy A.I. hackathon teams of The University of Texas at Austin, engineering and science students to build a data-driven model to predict oil production. This will require:

- Data analysis and evaluation of multiple data sources and a variety of features
- Spatial data analytics for spatial predictions and feature imputation
- Integration of domain expertise at every step
- Selection, training and tuning robust machine learning prediction models

This data-driven approach will replace the conventional engineering and geoscience approach:

- Characterizing and modeling the subsurface
- Physics-based fluid flow simulations
